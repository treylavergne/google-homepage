# google-homepage
Google homepage project from TOP.


This project is a challnge from The Odin Project to deconstruct Google's homepage and build it back from the ground up.
Here's the curriculum link: The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

What I've learned so far:

-Learned a lot more about Git and Githhub with this project than I thought I would so far(used to think a git push and git commit were the same thing - quickly realized they weren't).

-Learned that when lnking CSS Stylesheet, it helps to have everything speled correctly and the correct closing tag - it'll save 21 minutes of fustration.
